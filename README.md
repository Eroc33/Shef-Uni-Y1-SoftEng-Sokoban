A Terminal based implementation of the classic [sokoban game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) in ruby.
Created in 2015 for a 1st year software engineering module.

#Original README Content Below

This module *can* run on windows, but unless you feel like spending an hour or more installing some form of curses
library for the curses gem (required by dispel) then I'd recommend you run it on a *nix system or a mac
(or with msys2 on windows).

To play run the following commands:
`bundle install`
`ruby sokoban.rb`
